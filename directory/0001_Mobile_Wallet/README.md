MobileCoin is a cryptocurrency designed for high-speed encrypted payments. We have built the MobileCoin app so users can store, request, and send MobileCoin (MOB). We're still in the early days of the MobileCoin app, and it is currently only available as a beta version for iOS and Android.

Please follow the steps below to gain access to the MobileCoin beta app.

Both Android and iPhone users

Getting MOB into your MobileCoin app
====================================

The following steps are for US-based users. Users outside of the US can buy MOB directly at [www.buymobilecoin.com](http://www.buymobilecoin.com/).

1\. Buy Bitcoin on a coin exchange
----------------------------------

There are a number of coin exchanges, supporting thousands of cryptocurrencies. Two of the most user-friendly options are FTX and Coinbase.

*To buy Bitcoin on*[ *FTX*](https://ftx.us/)*:*

-   Register and complete the ID verification process to be able to trade on the platform. Detailed steps on registration and the ID verification process are available from[ FTX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am-oCJnZaug).
-   Once verified, log in to FTX and use the Wallet feature to deposit some Bitcoin (or other cryptocurrency) that you can exchange for MOB. For more details on buying cryptocurrencies on FTX, see this[ explainer video](https://youtu.be/8Lnm-ij7Ga4?t=195).

*To buy Bitcoin on*[ *Coinbase*](http://coinbase.com/)*:*

-   Register and complete the ID verification process to be able to trade on the platform. Detailed steps on registration and the ID verification process are available from[ Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/tips-and-tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-crypto-wallet).
-   Once verified, log in to Coinbase and add a payment method using the green button in the interface. (Coinbase will likely make two small deposits to your bank account, which appear immediately. Login to your bank account and enter the two deposit amounts when prompted.)
-   Once this step is complete, the green button will change and can be used to buy Bitcoin (or other cryptocurrencies).

2\. Download the[ Mixin Messenger](https://mixin.one/messenger) app
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Mixin Messenger is available on both iOS and Android. Create an account, and set a 6 digit pin. (You'll have to enter it four times.)

3\. Transfer your Bitcoin to your Mixin Messenger wallet
--------------------------------------------------------

Open the Mixin app, and tap the icon on the bottom left to open your wallet.

The default page of the wallet lists cryptocurrencies: find the line for Bitcoin (BTC) which opens the send and receive page. Tap on RECEIVE.

A popup will appear: the address here is only usable to receive Bitcoin (BTC). Tap on GOT IT and tap COPY to copy your wallet address to your clipboard.

On the next screen, tap on Bitcoin (BTC) and enter the amount of Bitcoin that you want to send. When ready, tap CONTINUE.

Choose NOT NOW when asked whether you would like to access your contacts to send crypto to a friend.

Paste the address (from your Mixin wallet) into the "To" field and tap PREVIEW SEND.

Check that everything looks correct and tap SEND NOW. Note that this transaction could take 30 minutes to an hour or more to show up in your Mixin wallet.

4\. Swap your Bitcoin for MOB in Mixin Wallet
---------------------------------------------

In your Mixin app, tap your initial/profile picture to open the contacts screen. Tap ADD CONTACT*,* enter the number 7000103767, and click SEARCH. This will locate a bot called MixSwap that you can use to convert BTC to MOB. Look for the purple bird logo:

Tapp on *+ *ADD BOT to add it to your app, and you can access it from your main screen in the app or by opening the bot screen.

Open the bot and tap the icon next to the text input field in the bottom. (It looks like a little robot with antennae.)

This will open the exchange screen. Select BTC as the PAY category, and MOB as the RECEIVE category.

![](https://mobilecoinwp.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/12.png)

Enter the amount of Bitcoin that you want to trade for MOB.

Note that the MixSwap bot does not tell you how much Bitcoin you have in your wallet. If you forgot, toggle back to your wallet to see the amount.

Once you enter the Bitcoin amount, the corresponding MOB amount will auto-populate.

Tap EXCHANGE --- you now own MobileCoin!
