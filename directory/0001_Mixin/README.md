## Send and Receive
First, you need to get your wallet address in your Mixin app. Open the Mixin app then choose the square icon on the bottom left corner to access your wallet. Once you are in your wallet, tap on the line that says BTC (Bitcoin). This will take you to the Bitcoin send and receive page. Tap on RECEIVE. A popup will appear; tap GOT IT. Then tap COPY to copy your wallet address.

## Connect the MixSwap Exchange
Tap on the search icon in the top right corner (the magnifying glass). Enter the number 7000103767 and tap SEARCH. This will locate a bot called MixSwap. You will know you have the right app because you will see a purple bird logo. Tap on the bot and add it to your app. Once you have the MixSwap bot installed, you can access the bot from your home screen in the app. 

## Swap Bitcoin for MobileCoin
Open the bot and tap the icon in the bottom right that looks like a little robot with antennae. This will open the exchange screen. Enter the amount of Bitcoin that you want to trade for MOB. The only tricky part here is that they do not tell you how much Bitcoin you have in your wallet, so you may need to toggle back to your wallet to see how much you have. Once you enter the Bitcoin amount, the corresponding MOB amount should auto-populate. Make sure that the receive category says MOB and tap EXCHANGE.

### ![](https://mobilecoinstg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/secure.svg)Step 1: Buy Bitcoin on a coin exchange

While there are a number of coin exchanges and thousands of cryptocurrencies, one of the easiest ways is to buy Bitcoin on a coin exchange like FTX.us or Coinbase.

To buy Bitcoin on [FTX](https://ftx.us/):

-   Register and go through the ID verification process. For more info and detailed steps to how to complete the ID verification process, check out [FTX's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am-oCJnZaug).
-   At the top of the FTX page, click WALLET to deposit some Bitcoin to exchange for MOB. You can use your credit card to purchase Bitcoin directly on FTX. Click the BUY BTC WITH CREDIT CARD button, and now you have Bitcoin in your wallet. For more details, here's an [explainer video](https://youtu.be/8Lnm-ij7Ga4?t=195).

To buy Bitcoin on [Coinbase.com](http://coinbase.com/):

-   Register and go through the ID verification process. For more info and detailed steps of how to set up a Coinbase account and buy Bitcoin, check out [Coinbase's tutorial](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/tips-and-tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-crypto-wallet).
-   Once you have set up your account, a green button will appear to add a payment method. Coinbase will likely make two small deposits to your bank account, which appear immediately. Login to your bank account and enter the two deposit amounts when prompted. Once you do this, the green button will change to say BUY CRYPTO.

Mixin Messenger is available on both iOS and Android. Create an account. You will need to choose a 6 digit pin and enter it four times (they really don't want you to forget this pin).

### ![](https://mobilecoinstg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/secure.svg)Step 3: Transfer your Bitcoin to your Mixin Messenger wallet on your phone

First, you need to get your wallet address in your Mixin app. Open the Mixin app then choose the square icon on the bottom left corner to access your wallet.

![](https://mobilecoinstg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/image13-1.png)

Once you are in your wallet, click on the line that says BTC (Bitcoin). This will take you to the Bitcoin send and receive page. Click on RECEIVE.

![](https://mobilecoinstg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/image4-473x1024.png)

A popup will appear; click GOT IT. Then click COPY to copy your wallet address.

![](https://mobilecoinstg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/image7-blur-473x1024.png)

Now you need to go back to Coinbase. You can do this on a desktop or you can use their mobile app. If you are using the mobile app, please follow the instructions below. If using a desktop, you can find those instructions at the top of this post in the desktop section.

Login to your Coinbase app. At the bottom of the home screen you will see five icons. Click the one in the middle with the two arrows. This will open a popup where you can then choose the SEND option.

![](https://mobilecoinstg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/image19-473x1024.png)

This will take you to a screen that lists the different types of cryptocurrencies that you own. Click on BTC (Bitcoin). Enter the amount of Bitcoin that you want to send (in USD) and choose CONTINUE.

![](https://mobilecoinstg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/image29-473x1024.png)

It will ask you if you would like to access your contacts to send crypto to a friend. Choose NOT NOW. Then paste the address from your Mixin wallet into the TO field and choose PREVIEW SEND.

![](https://mobilecoinstg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/image5-1-473x1024.png)

Make sure everything looks correct and click SEND NOW. This transaction could take 30 minutes to an hour or more to show up in your Mixin wallet.

### ![](https://mobilecoinstg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/secure.svg)Step 4: Swap your Bitcoin for MOB in Mixin Wallet

There are two sub steps to this last step. First, go back to your Mixin app and click on the search icon in the top right corner (the magnifying glass). Enter the number 7000103767 and click SEARCH. This will locate a bot called MixSwap. You will know you have the right app because you will see a purple bird logo.

![](https://mobilecoinstg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/image24.png)

Click on the bot and add it to your app. Once you have the MixSwap bot installed, you can access the bot from your home screen in the app.

Once you are inside the bot, click the icon in the bottom right that looks like a little robot with antennae.

![](https://mobilecoinstg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/image18.png)

This will open the exchange screen. Enter the amount of Bitcoin that you want to trade for MOB. The only tricky part here is that they do not tell you how much Bitcoin you have in your wallet, so you may need to toggle back to your wallet to see how much you have. Once you enter the Bitcoin amount, the corresponding MOB amount should auto-populate. Make sure that the receive category says MOB and click EXCHANGE.

### ![](https://mobilecoinstg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/secure.svg)Step 5: Move your MOB into your MobileCoin desktop wallet

First, quit and restart your MobileCoin desktop wallet TWICE to make sure it updates and is running the latest version. In your MobileCoin desktop wallet, tap the SEND/RECEIVE tab and then tap RECEIVE MOB. Tap the button in the top right corner of the address box to turn your address into a QR code.

![](https://mobilecoinstg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-11-30-at-12.39.52-PM-752x1024.png)

In Mixin Messenger on your phone, where all of your currencies are listed, tap on the MOB section. Tap SEND. It will ask if you want to send to a contact or an address. Choose ADDRESS.

![](https://mobilecoinstg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_2018-473x1024.png)

On the address screen tap the PLUS sign in the top right corner to add your MobileCoin desktop wallet address. Name your wallet in the Label section. In the Address section tap the square on the right side to open the camera and then use your phone to scan the QR code on your MobileCoin desktop wallet on your computer. Once you scan the code it should populate in the address line. You may need to enter a memo on the last line to activate the Continue button. Tap CONTINUE and enter your pin.

![](https://mobilecoinstg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_2020-473x1024.png)

You should then see your address listed on the Address page. Tap on the address and it will open to a screen where you can enter the amount you would like to send. Enter the amount and tap CONTINUE. Enter your pin again.

![](https://mobilecoinstg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_2021-473x1024.png)

This completes your transaction! You should see your MOB show up in your MobileCoin desktop wallet momentarily. Be aware that sometimes you may need to restart your desktop wallet for the transaction to appear.
